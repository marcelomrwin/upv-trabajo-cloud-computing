    "title": "What Is The Weight Of The Cross That Jesus Carried?",
    "description": "In John 19:17, John says Jesus carried the cross while in Matthew 27:32, Mark 15:21 and Luke 23:26 we are informed that Simon of Cyrene helped Jesus to carry the cross. There are no exact figures on the weight of the cross. It is believed to have been made of solid wood , so the whole cross is estimated to be over 300 pounds (136 kilograms) while the crossbar is estimated to be around 70 -90 pounds (32-41 kilograms) .\n\nWeakened by the torture, scourging, humiliation and beatings, carrying even a crossbar would have been too much for Jesus. That is why they had to force Simon to help Jesus bear the burden. But there was one burden Simon could not help Jesus with â€“ the burden of the sin of all mankind; past, present and future.",
